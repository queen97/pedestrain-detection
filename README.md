# pedestrain-detection
EDESTRIAN-DETECTOR
Detects pedestrians in webcam live stream or video.
Activity in defined area is monitored
Contains 2 algorithms (they all do more or less the same):
# Python optical flow tracking

Using Optical Flow for pedestrian detection.

1. using video path : python optical_flow.py [video source]  
2. using camera : python optical_flow.py   



#detect the pedestrian using HOG+SVM in python 
Includes non-maximum suppression
#Run this code test on windows 10
Few little changing to the original python script to make it run with opencv 3.2.1
